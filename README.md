# mini-project-3
The purpose of this project is create a javascript that will randomly generate a password after being given certain criteria
After the user clicks a button a variety of password criteria will be given to the user and they will choose which ones they
desire to have. This will include: length of password, if they want capital letters, lowercase, special characters, or 
numbers. After answering each promot an alert will be given to validate the users choice and to to let the user know to make a choice in at least one criteria if none or selected. After everything is answered a password will be created and displayed.
